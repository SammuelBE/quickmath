> Create a game that shows an equation. A, B, and C should be random numbers, and Y should be the proposed answer.

> The user should be able to answer whether it is true that the sum of A, B, and C equals the proposed answer Y.

> Every time the user answers a question, a new question that uses randomly generated numbers is displayed.
